# NVIM - Configuration

This is my nvim setup I use for programming primarily in C++.
You can either use this config as is, or use it as a starting point
for your own configuration.

I switched to using kickstart.nvim as a base. Thanks a lot to them for providing it!

It should also be noted that you should back up your old confing as the following command will delete your old one.

## Installation:
> `rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/ && cd ~/.config/ && git clone https://github.com/Erarnitox/nvim`
