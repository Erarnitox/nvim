# NVIM - Configuration

This is my nvim setup I use for programming primarily in C++.
You can either use this config as is, or use it as a starting point
for your own configuration.

## Installation:
> requires packer.nvim to be installed!

> `rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/ && cd ~/.config/ && git clone https://github.com/Erarnitox/nvim`
